<!-- Main versioning block. Short page for dotcom -->
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s Docker registry (which used the namespace `docker.pkg.github.com`) has been replaced by the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} (which uses the namespace `https://ghcr.io`). The {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} offers benefits such as granular permissions and storage optimization for Docker images.

Docker images previously stored in the Docker registry are being automatically migrated into the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}. For more information, see "[Migrating to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} from the Docker registry](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/migrating-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry)" and "[Working with the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}](/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)."
